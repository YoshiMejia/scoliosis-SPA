            <h1 className="banner">Thoracic Scoliosis</h1>
            <p>Our doctors see Thoracic scoliosis in children between the ages of 10-15.  Most children get this type of scoliosis when they go through their first major growth spurt. It may also develop later in life as a result of muscle or connective tissue disorders and other degenerative conditions.
        <br />
            Because thoracic scoliosis affects the region of the spine that connects to the rib cage, many patients first become aware of the condition because of differences to the rib cage and shoulder blades, as well as uneven shoulder height.
        <br />
            Thoracic scoliosis occurs with a C shaped curve in the middle section of the spine.  This area, known as the thoracic vertebrae, may develop on its own.  Or it may develop with other types of scoliosis, and when this happens it typically produces an S shape in the spine as the two curves form in different directions.

        <h1>Symptoms</h1>
            <p>The symptoms of thoracic scoliosis differ from person to person and depend on a number of factors, such as age and stage of development of the patient, as well as the location and severity of the curve, and many more.

            Some symptoms of thoracic scoliosis include:
            </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uneven shoulder height</li>
        <li>Uneven rib cage</li>
        <li>Back pain</li>
        <li>Uneven shoulder blades</li>
        <li>Uneven waist height</li>
